## Plotly works with "iris" dataset from seaborn 

import seaborn as sns
import plotly.express as px

df_iris = sns.load_dataset("iris")

fig = px.scatter_3d(df_iris,
                    x='sepal_length', y='sepal_width', z='petal_width',
                    color='species')

st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True, sharing="streamlit")

# It is even more clear through the 3D scatter plot that there are obvious clusters between different species.
# Setosa is much more different than other two species.
